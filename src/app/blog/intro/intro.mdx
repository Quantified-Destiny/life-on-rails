# Introducing Life on Rails 
## A new integrated goal-habit tracker that will actually help you achieve your goals.

Irvine, CA, Jun 1, 2023 - Hybrid Studios today announced the launch of their innovative new habit tracker, designed to give users more context and the power to track their progress in whatever manner suits them.

Any behavior or action you engage in regularly counts as a habit â€” from having coffee as soon as you get to the office to brushing your teeth just before going to bed.
By all accounts and measures, habits are the cornerstone of success; good habits make success effortless.

Habit trackers are a vital tool in building habits. However, they often fall short of their goal. 
Traditional habit trackers present a simplistic, almost naive, view of how habit formation works. 
They often use extremely simple metrics to track progress. 
They also don't provide much context about how and why each habit matters - without this, it's quite hard to maintain the motivation to stick to an action long enough for it to become a habit. 

Drawing upon decades of experience, as well as the latest findings from neuroscience and productivity research, Hybrid Studios is developing a new habit tracker called *Life on Rails*.

Habits often reinforce each other; good habits create other good habits. 
This is why breaking one good habit can sometimes lead to everything falling apart.
By linking habits to specific goals, you gain insight into the impact that breaking a habit may have on the things they value. 
Hybrid Studios's innovative scoring system calculates and aggregates scores across interconnected items, making it effortless to identify underperforming areas and understand the underlying reasons. 
Furthermore, the scoring system is highly customizable, allowing individuals to tailor it to their unique preferences and needs.
Though this, you can quickly diagnose failures and identify the most optimal next steps.

Tracking a habit is often a fairly complex and subjective thing. 
Life on Rails offers a highly configurable metric system that allows you to track progress in whatever way works for you.

The app offers timeline and review features which provide a high-level summary of your last few quarters and actionable advice on how to move forwards.
It also offers a template system to get started quickly.

The initial beta of the product is current available [here](https://life-on-rails.netlify.app).

An upcoming premium plan will remove all limits on the number of items and includes several powerful features, including:

1. More powerful filtering, search, and aggregation tools.
2. A fully customizable dashboard; track everything important to you, all in one page.
3. Integrations with third-party tools; use third-party data to automatically track and complete habits.
4. AI Coach: the coach will help you work though your goals, suggest new ones, and help you tweak your item graph to better fit your life.

Hybrid Studios is a small Irvine-based tech company, founded one year ago by Sumeet Padavala, Brian Ha, and Sabina Yang with the mission of unleashing the power in everyone, one habit at a time.
