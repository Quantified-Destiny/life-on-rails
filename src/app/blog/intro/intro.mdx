# Introducing Life on Rails

Irvine, CA - [Company Name] is excited to announce the launch of its innovative new habit tracker, designed to help users track and achieve their personal goals like never before.

Traditional habit trackers don't work.
Historically, habit trackers have been very rigid with the way they track progress.
They also don't usually help you the big picture.

At [Company Name], we believe that consistency, perspective, and motivation are the pillars of success.
Over the last year, we've our distilled decades of experience and the very latest insights from neuroscience and productivity research into our latest product.

Today, We're launching Life on Rails, a new kind of habit tracker that will actually get you moving towards your goals.

Life is messy and complex. Through custom metrics and powerful scheduling tools, you can track habits in whatever way makes sense.

Building habits in isolation is really hard. Sometimes, it doesn't really feel like sticking to a habit really moves the needle.
When faced with the infinite options of what we can do with our time, we often, with the best of intentions, decide to do something else.
To help with this, we've also built a goal-tracking system that integrates deeply with the habit tracker.

By linking your habits to goals, you can see exactly which of the things you care about will be affected if you break a habit.
Our innovative scoring system propagates and aggregates scores across linked items, which makes it incredibly easy to see exactly which items are underperforming and why.
And, of course, the scoring system is incredibly customizable.

Habits often reinforce each other; good habits create other habits. This is why breaking one good habit can sometimes lead to everything falling apart.
By connecting multiple habits to the same goal, you can quickly spot these sorts of failures and head them off before they become dangerous.

When you're ready to step back and reevaluate things, the timeline and review pages provide high-level information on how your last few months have been going.
They also offer actionable advice on what you could do to get better at the things you care about.

If you don't feel like configuring everything yourself, don't worry! Our template system will get you up and running in seconds.
